This project aims to create a tool for planning meals. Main goals are:
* allow planning meals ahead (for a week or any chosen period)
* choose from recipes that are available online by integrating with
already existing online cookbooks
* keep track of nutritional values provided by each meal
* allow to specify what nutrition goals are to be met and compare
them agains chosen meals
* create shopping lists for planned period

There are also multiple ideas of extending the base functionality by:
* allowing the app to automatically choose meals, or some of them
to meet given criteria
* integrating with online shop to do groceries
* integrate with reminder/todo list apps such as Google Keep
* using OCR or barcode to find nutritional values of a product
* keep an inventory of food products that a user already has
